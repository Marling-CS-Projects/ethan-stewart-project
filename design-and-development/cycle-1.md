# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

In the first cycle I have decided to make a basic layout for a home page with very limited functionality. I have done this with a combination of HTML and CSS. I am keeping it simple as the features of this project are a priority, so any addition customisation will be handled in future cycles.

### Objectives

Create a simple home page which the user can use to navigate to the tools of this application.

* [x] Create a layout for the home page
* [x] Add simple customisation to improve user experience.
