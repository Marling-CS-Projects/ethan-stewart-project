# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The purpose of the website is clear     | fail         |
| 2           | The user understands what data to enter | success      |

### Feature 1

The purpose of the website was definitely not as clear as I would have liked it. I feel like this was largely down to a lack of description on the website. The only information available to the user was the title. This meant the user was going in blind when using the website. However, this did not severely impact the user experience as the purpose of the website became clear after following the input prompts. This should be a simple fix as I can add a description of the purpose of the program in future development.

### Feature 2

From my research the user was perfectly able to use the website without issues. Most of the people that tested the website said that it was easy to use. I ensured this by using very simple language in the input prompts. This way there can be no confusion over what to enter.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                  | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Clear how to use the website | success          |
| 2           | level of user input is low.  | success and fail |

### Feature 1

The design of the website made it very clear how to use it. By using a simplistic design, I was able to make the website approachable for more people. As a result of this, most people who tested the website said that they found it easy to use. This mean the experience was more efficient.

### Feature 2

The level of user input is low when compared to what's involved to do a similar task on a different software. However, it is not as low as I would have liked. When initially designing the website, it was planned that the program would choose the stock to trade for you with the only input being the investment amount. This is however very complex and with additional development time could definitely be added to the the website.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                             | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | A good introduction to trading          | success          |
| 2           | enough information to do extra research | success and fail |

### Feature 1

I would say the website has acted as a good introduction to trading. It introduces you to the basic structures of trading, such as the stock and investment amount, as well as giving you a good idea of the possible returns on a trade. Overall it provides a somewhat engaging first experience.

### Feature 2

The reason I say its a success is that I have been able to find a good website that gives a run down of the risks of trading. However this is not enough. What I would have liked to have done is implement a little tab with a few links to websites. These websites should give a good run down of all the basic to trading, not just money safety issues. This would be a very simple feature to add and could quite easily be implemented into the current website in future development.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The website does not crash | success      |
| 2           | The website has no bugs.   | success      |

### Feature 1

The website does not crash when using it, even after extended periods of time. Before releasing it to other to test, I ran a couple a scenarios in which I found that there was only one way to crash the website. This was easy to fix as it involved preventing the user from performing a certain action. This was done with a simple if statement.

### Feature 2

I was able to test the website and as far as using the website, there were no bugs. Most people who tested the website agreed that there no were no bugs and that they could use the website without error messages and other issues. The reason I say most is because one person was able to abuse the fact that the website is on a development server meaning it does not have the security features on https. He was able to use a built in website checker to check if it was safe and that broke the website.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Is it easy to get started | success      |

### Feature 1

I can confidently say that it was easy to hop on and use the website. The results from the user feedback form would agree with most people saying its easy to get started. I put this down to the simple one page structure of the website. As the user loads the page, they are immediately presented with options to enter data.
