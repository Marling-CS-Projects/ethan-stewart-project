# 1.1 Problem Identification

According to analysts, 70% of US equities in 2013 were carried out by algorithm trading and the use of trading algorithms has since then been increasing. Algorithm trading first emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the creation of the internet. It wasn't until 1998 when algorithm trading really started to pick up, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission authorizing electronic exchanges. ([The Robust Trader, 2022](../reference-list.md)). The foundation for algorithm trading was laid on innovations in high frequency trading. The first innovation in HFT came from a man called Julius Reuter, in the 19th century. He used a combination combination of technology including telegraph cables and a fleet of carrier pigeons to run a news delivery system. ([Quantinsti, 2015](../reference-list.md))

One of the big reasons that algorithmic trading has become so popular is because of the advantages that it has over human share trading. Some advantages of algo-trading are related to speed, accuracy, and reduced costs. Since algorithms are written beforehand and are executed automatically, the main advantage is speed. The speed at which these trades are made is fractions of seconds, much faster than humans can perceive. Trading with algorithms has the advantage of scanning and executing on multiple indicators at a speed that no human could do. Since trades can be analyzed and executed faster, more opportunities are available at better prices. One of the biggest advantages of algo-trading is the ability to remove human emotion from trading, as trades are constrained within a set of predefined criteria. This is an advantage because humans are susceptible to emotions that lead to irrational decisions. The two emotions that lead to poor decisions that algo-traders aren't susceptible to are fear, and greed. Another advantage of automated trading is the reduced transaction costs. With algo-trading, traders don't have to spend as much time monitoring the markets, as trades can be executed without continuous supervision. The huge time reduction for trading lowers transaction costs because of the saved opportunity cost of constantly monitoring the markets. ([NASDAQ, 2019](../reference-list.md)).

According to a graph from [The Economist (2019)](../reference-list.md) we can see people value these advantages presented by algo-trading. In the US public equities are worth $31 trillion. Algo-trading or automated trading accounted for 35.1% of trades executed. That's just under $11 trillion in funds. The percentage share is much greater than human managed funds. In addition to this, there is a much wider range of funds and indexes managed by algo-trading, showing is ability to be highly diverse.

Lets look a bit closer at what algorithm trading is. Algorithm trading uses a computer program that follows a set of instructions to place a trade. in theory, the trade can generate profit at a speed and frequency not possible for a human trader. The defined sets of instructions are based on timing, price, quantity, or any mathematical model. Apart from profit opportunities for the trader, algo-trading renders markets more liquid and trading more systematic by ruling out the impact of human emotions on trading activities. Using these two simple instructions, a computer program will automatically monitor the stock price (and the moving average indicators) and place the buy and sell orders when the defined conditions are met. The trader no longer needs to monitor live prices and graphs or put in the orders manually. The algorithmic trading system does this automatically by correctly identifying the trading opportunity.
