# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle, I create a JavaScript function that will validate the user inputs before they are submitted and processed. This is done with a set of if statements. Every possibility is covered so no matter what the user enters, the correct data will always be entered. In addition to this I added a link to a website that gives information on the risks of trading.

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* Make the code unbreakable
* Refuse entry of incorrect data

#### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

No usability features were added in this cycle.

#### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable Name    | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| stockName        | Stores the value of the "stock\_name" input.        |
| investment       | Stores the value of the "investment" input.         |
| startDate        | Stores the value of the "start\_date" input.        |
| confirmLiability | Stores the value of the "confirm\_liability" input. |

#### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>

```
function validateForm():
    stockName = get value of "stock_name" input
    investment = get value of "investment" input
    startDate = get value of "start_date" input
    confirmLiability = get value of "confirm_liability" input

    if stockName is empty or investment is empty or startDate is empty:
        display "All fields must be filled out" message
        return false

    if confirmLiability in lowercase is not equal to "yes":
        display "You must confirm liability by typing 'yes'" message
        return false

    if stockName in lowercase is not equal to "orcl" and stockName in lowercase is not equal to "nvda" and stockName in lowercase is not equal to "yhoo":
        display "Only three stocks are currently simulated. Choose one of those." message
        return false

    if investment is not a positive integer:
        display "Please make sure your investment is a positive number." message
        return false

    if startDate is less than 1999 or startDate is greater than 2014:
        display "Start year must be between 1999 and 2014 inclusive" message
        return false

```

### Development <a href="#development" id="development"></a>

```javascript
function validateForm() {
    // Get the value of the "stock_name" input field
    var stockName = document.getElementById("stock_name").value;

    // Get the value of the "investment" input field
    var investment = document.getElementById("investment").value;

    // Get the value of the "start_date" input field
    var startDate = document.getElementById("start_date").value;

    // Get the value of the "confirm_liability" input field
    var confirmLiability = document.getElementById("confirm_liability").value;

    // Check if any of the required fields are empty
    if (stockName == "" || investment == "" || startDate == "") {
        alert("All fields must be filled out");
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the user didn't confirm liability by typing "yes"
    if (confirmLiability.toLowerCase() != "yes") {
        alert("You must confirm liability by typing 'yes'");
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the stock name is not one of the three allowed options
    if (stockName.toLowerCase() != "orcl" && stockName.toLowerCase() != "nvda" && stockName.toLowerCase() != "yhoo") {
        alert("Only three stocks are currently simulated. Choose one of those.");
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the investment is not a positive integer
    if (Number.isInteger(investment) || investment < 1) {
        alert("Please make sure your investment is a positive number.");
        return false;
    }

    // Check if the start date is not within the specified range
    if (startDate < 1999 || startDate > 2014) {
        alert("Start year must be between 1999 and 2014 inclusive");
        return false;
    }
}

```

#### Outcome <a href="#outcome" id="outcome"></a>

The outcome was once again very positive for this cycle. I used the IDs of the elements in order to retrieve the user entered data. I then  put that data through some simple if statements to check if the data is valid. By converting any test data to lower case I was able to ensure that the data can be accurately checked and not have any case sensitive issues.

### Testing <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>

#### Tests <a href="#tests" id="tests"></a>

| Test | Instructions                        | What I expect                              | What actually happens     | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Leave something blank               | Warns to fill in all fields                | As expected               | Pass      |
| 2    | incorrect data for name of stock    | Warns to enter simulated stock             | As expected               | Pass      |
| 3    | Incorrect data for number of stocks | Warns to enter a positive number           | Didn't refuse non-numbers | Fail      |
| 4    | incorrect data for timeframe        | warns to keep number between certain years | As expected               | Pass      |
| 5    | didn't confirm liability            | warns to confirm liability                 | As expected               | Fail      |

The acceptance of non-numbers was mostly down to the input type on the html file. Initially I was using a text type then converting to integer on the python page. However by changing the input type to number, I was able to automatically block out the user from entering non-numbers. I still had to convert to integer in the python file.
