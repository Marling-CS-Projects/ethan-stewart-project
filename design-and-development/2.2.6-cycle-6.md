# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle I implemented a new python library to more efficiently and easily implement my python script into the html page. In addition to this I also redesigned the html page into a more simple form. This was to move the development process more in line with the time before my deadline.

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* [ ] Post data to the python file
* [ ] Return the user input to the html file

#### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

No usability features are added in this cycle.

#### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

The following variables are from the html:

| Variable Name      | Input Type | Label                        |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| stock\_name        | text       | Stock Name                   |
| investment         | number     | Investment amount            |
| start\_date        | number     | Start Date                   |
| confirm\_liability | text       | Please confirm you are aware |

The following variables are from the python file:

| Variable Name | Data Type |
| ------------- | --------- |
| stock\_name   | string    |
| investment    | float     |
| start\_date   | integer   |

#### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>

This is the pseudocode for the python file

```
Initialize Flask application with the name of the current module

Define route for the home page ("/") and another route ("/home")
    Define function 'home' to handle requests to these routes
        Return the rendered 'index.html' template

Define route for the result page ("/result") to handle both POST and GET requests
    Define function 'result' to handle requests to this route
        Convert form data from the request to a dictionary and store it in 'output'

        Extract 'stock_name' from 'output' and store it in 'stock_name'
        Extract 'investment' from 'output', convert it to a float, and store it in 'investment'
        Extract 'start_date' from 'output', convert it to an integer, and store it in 'start_date'
Return the rendered 'index.html' template with the following variables:
    'stock_name' set to the value of 'stock_name'
    'investment' set to the value of 'investment'
    'start_date' set to the value of 'start_date'

```

### Development <a href="#development" id="development"></a>

This pathway shift was quite successful. The html file was fairly easy to redesign and sending the data to the python file was also fairly simple. However there were a few problems in returning the data to the html file.

````python
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route("/")
@app.route("/home")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")


@app.route("/result", methods=["POST", "GET"])
def result():
    output = request.form.to_dict()

    stock_name = output["stock_name"]
    investment = float(output["investment"])
    start_date = int(output["start_date"])

    return render_template("index.html", stock_name=stock_name, investment=investment, start_date=start_date)
```
````

When you click the html file submit button, the data entered by the user is sent to the end point which is the /result endpoint. From there, I use a result function to translate the form data to a python dictionary. This allows me to access the data in python. I then assign the keys to different variables, each one representing a different value. I return these variables to the html file and then using squiggly brackets I can display the python variables.

````html
```html
<div>
        <p style="color: blue;">{{stock_name}} </p>
        <p style="color: blue;">{{investment}} </p>
        <p style="color: blue;">{{start_date}} </p>
</div>
```
````

#### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

The main challenge I had was finding a way to return the data to the html form. A frequent errors that I had was with the isolating of the python dictionary content in order to display it individually in the html file. My initial method was to export the python dictionary as a whole object and then iterate through that in html and withdraw the values. This however didn't work as there were issues exporting the whole dictionary. I eventually settled on breaking it down into individual variables in the python file and then exporting those individual variables.

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Click submit | The data entered disappears and go to endpoint /result       | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Click submit | The data I just entered is displayed below on seperate lines | As expected           | Pass      |
