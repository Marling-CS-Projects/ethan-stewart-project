## Thinking Abstractly and Visualization

Abstraction is an important principle in computer science and is the process of removing excessive details to reach a representation of a problem that consists of only the key features. It frequently involves analysing what is relevant to the problem and what is irrelevant. I will use abstraction in the project when:

* Displaying analytics - I removing many of the complex and largely unnecessary figures, I will create a more simple environment without the wide range of complexities which will only dampen the user experience. Some of these analytics are only necessary for those looking to make a living off of trading.
* Site design - the design of the site is going to focus on the core mechanics. This includes easy to read text with no fancy font, basic animations (no need for flair) and a simple to use navigation system. All this will contribute to a simplified user experience which should help enhance understandability.&#x20;

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is very important in creating a programmed solution, especially in a time constrained situation such as the one we are creating this project. It involves thinking ahead about what the core components are that the project will be made of. In doing so you allow yourself to identify any problems that may arise and any solutions that can be used to make these problems as smooth as possible. This could involves setting these problems out in there most basic form and setting preconditions for different sub routines.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
