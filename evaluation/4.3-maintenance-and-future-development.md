# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Quality of animations -** at the moment there are very simple animations in place on some parts of the website. I definitely think adding more to the website would make the overall user experience much better.
* **Pleasantness to use -** I would say that the website is pleasant to use however the public opinion seems to be more mixed. I would certainly like to consult with others in order to make the user experience as pleasant as possible.
* **Simplify the money returned -** at the moment the money returned to the screen is either a decimal of incorrectly formatted (doesn't match the text before it). This for me is a must fix in order to simplify the website.
* **Only three stocks simulated -** at the moment I only have three stocks simulated. This is not enough and would like to add many more. Ideally finding a way to connect it to the web so you can just pull data from the web.
* **No live trading -** at the moment, the website does not include live stock simulation. This is a huge downside and this feature is definitely something I will explore implementing into my website. It would hugely increase the users engagement with the website.
* **Expand the testing data to present day -** the historical data used at the moment only goes up to 2014. I would like to extend this to the present day in order to make the website more comprehensive.
