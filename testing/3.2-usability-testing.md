## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is it easy to understand what the program does? Is it clear what data you need to provide?            |
| 2 - Efficient      | is it clear where you need to enter user data? Is the level of user input low enough?                 |
| 3 - Engaging       | Does it give a good introduction to trading? Is there enough information for you to do more research. |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs in the program? Does the program run well without crashing.                        |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was it difficult to get started? Was there maybe to much user input?                                  |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

In order to gather opinions on my program I used a google form to get information from my friends and family. I based the questions off my success criteria.



### Effective and Efficient

From the graph you can see that all people completely agreed that the input prompts were easy to understand. This is good as it was important that people knew what data to enter otherwise it you enter an endless cycle of error messages.

Another good result is that all people agreed that the UI was structured in a simple way. This is once again very important as the UI often dictates the speed at which someone is able to navigate a site.
