# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                             | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The purpose of the website is clear     | fail         |
| 2           | The user understands what data to enter | success      |

### Feature 1

The purpose of the website was definitely not as clear as I would have liked it. I feel like this was largely down to a lack of description on the website. The only information available to the user was the title. This meant the user was going in blind when using the website. However, this did not severely impact the user experience as the purpose of the website became clear after following the input prompts. This should be a simple fix as I can add a description of the purpose of the program in future development.

### Feature 2

From my research the user was perfectly able to use the website without issues. Most of the people that tested the website said that it was easy to use. I ensured this by using very simple language in the input prompts. This way there can be no confusion over what to enter.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                  | Success/Fail     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1           | Clear how to use the website | success          |
| 2           | level of user input is low.  | success and fail |

### Feature 1

The desgin of the website made it very clear how to use it. By using a simplistic design, I was able to make the website approachable for more people. As a result of this, most people who tested the website said that they found it easy to use. This mean the experience was more efficient.

### Feature 2

The level of user input is low when compared to what's involved to do a similar task on a different software. However, it is not as low as I would have liked. When initially designing the website, it was planned that the program would choose the stock to trade for you with the only input being the investment amount. This is however very complex and with additional development time could definitely be added to the the website.
