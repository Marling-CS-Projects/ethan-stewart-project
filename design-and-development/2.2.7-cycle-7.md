# 2.2.7 Cycle 7

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle, I implemented the python script that uses the data to make trades. Not much changes with the form. However after clicking submit, the amount of money you make (or lose) is returned

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* Return the money made or lost

#### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

No usability features were added in this cycle.

#### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

Same key variables as cycles 5 and 6.

#### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>

```
Import the required modules

Create a Flask app object

Define a function to handle the home route and render the index.html template

Define a function to handle the result route and get the form data

Get the stock name, investment amount, and start date from the form data

Define a class for the trading strategy

Define the parameters for the fast and slow moving averages

Define a function to log messages with dates

Define a function to handle order notifications and print the order status and execution details

Define an initialization function to create two simple moving averages and a crossover indicator

Define a next function to execute buy and sell orders based on the crossover signal

If this is the main module, then:
Create a Cerebro object and add the strategy

Create a data feed from Yahoo Finance CSV file with the given stock name and date range

Add the data feed to Cerebro

Set the initial cash for the broker

Get the starting value of the portfolio

Run Cerebro

Get the end value of the portfolio

Calculate the earned amount by subtracting the starting value from the end value

Print the final portfolio value

Render the index.html template with the earned amount as a variable

If this is the main module, then run the app in debug mode and on port 5000
```

#### Outcome <a href="#outcome" id="outcome"></a>

Outcome was very positive. I had to convert the html form data to their correct data type and then insert those into the code where required. The only issue I had was with the file orcl.csv, which wasn't being recognised as a real file. I was unsure what caused this error initially but I deleted the file and created it again and everything worked fine after that. The only issue I saw was with the number of decimals on the returned data. in a future cycle I will need to limit that to 2 or three to make the page more neat.

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                   | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Click submit | return the amount of money made | As expected           | Pass      |
