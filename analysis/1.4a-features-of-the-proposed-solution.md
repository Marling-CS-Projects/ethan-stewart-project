# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## User interface

### Home page

I want to set the tone for the application with this homepage. Therefore, ease of navigation is very important. Users of this application likely have very little experience with using these types algorithms so making the experience as smooth and as simple as possible is important. Different features within in the site must be clearly labelled. A small description of some sort should pop up when hovering over a button. This should inform users what that particular feature will do. The image below shows a very basic concept of what the page could look like.

### Graph display

In trading, charts are obviously the most important thing that you use to make an informed decisions on what stocks to buy. Therefore, I would like to stick with the generic red and green which should provide plain and simple information about market activity at a glance. All colours must stand out so placing these charts on a black background will improve visibility and reduce clutter.&#x20;

In addition to this, on the charts, I will also display points at which the algorithm has bought and sold shares. It is important to give the user as much information about the algorithms as possible so the user can step in and take control of the portfolio is necessary. Whilst the system will be mostly AI controlled, some user control features should be implemented for peace of mind reasons.

### Outflow and inflow management

One of the features I would like to add to my website is outflow and inflow management. Basically understanding what money your portfolio is receiving or where money is being lost. This is an incredibly important feature as it should give the user an overview of the return rate of their portfolio. The center piece of this should be a red or green text plus arrow indicating the direction of returns on your portfolio, whether that be positive (green) or negative (red). It should then contain a break down of where that money is going / coming from. For example, which shares you are investing in, money lost from those investments, which investments are gaining you money, how much money remains in your portfolio wallet.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
