# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

This cycle is meant to focus on the beginnings of the algorithm I will be using to pick and trade shares. I will use an API called Alpaca API. This will give me access to a paper trading system (not using real life shares). This code needs to be able to fetch my account information from Alpaca.

## Objectives

* [x] Begin foundation of the Alpaca API
* [x] Fetch the price of specific shares

## Usability features

This part of the program is not seen by the user. However I have taken steps to ensure that its easier for me to follow the code whilst I'm writing it. To do this I have added ample spacing between each line and comments to remind me of what each part does.

## Key Variables

The key variables in the code are:

&#x20;`API_KEY`,&#x20;

`SECRET_KEY`,&#x20;

`stock_client`,&#x20;

`multisymbol_request_params`,&#x20;

`latest_multisymbol_qoutes`,&#x20;

`gld_latest_ask_price`,&#x20;

`spy_latest_ask_price`,

`tlt_latest_ask_price`.

`API_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` are used to authenticate the user with the Alpaca API. `stock_client` is an instance of the `StockHistoricalDataClient` class, which is used to retrieve historical data for stocks.&#x20;

`multisymbol_request_params` is an instance of the `StockLatestQuoteRequest` class, which is used to request the latest quotes for multiple symbols.&#x20;

`latest_multisymbol_qoutes` is a dictionary containing the latest quotes for the requested symbols.&#x20;

`gld_latest_ask_price`, `spy_latest_ask_price`, and `tlt_latest_ask_price` are variables that store the latest ask prices for the GLD, SPY, and TLT symbols respectively.

## Pseudocode

```
Import StockHistoricalDataClient and StockLatestQuoteRequest from alpaca.data

Set API_KEY to "PKBFRFWBV2IIXYC9BPQ5"
Set SECRET_KEY to "9rZHrcqHyVAqh6TrljCTayCfghqTmY9HRpkBK7uE"

Create a new instance of StockHistoricalDataClient with API_KEY and SECRET_KEY as arguments and assign it to stock_client

Create a new instance of StockLatestQuoteRequest with ["SPY", "GLD", "TLT"] as the argument for symbol_or_symbols and assign it to multisymbol_request_params

Call the get_stock_latest_quote method of stock_client with multisymbol_request_params as the argument and assign the result to latest_multisymbol_qoutes

Get the ask_price of "GLD" from latest_multisymbol_qoutes and assign it to gld_latest_ask_price
Get the ask_price of "SPY" from latest_multisymbol_qoutes and assign it to spy_latest_ask_price
Get the ask_price of "TLT" from latest_multisymbol_qoutes and assign it to tlt_latest_ask_price

Print "The current price of TLT is " + tlt_latest_ask_price
Print "The current price of SPY is " + spy_latest_ask_price
Print "The current price of GLD is " + gld_latest_ask_price
```

## Development

### Outcome

In this cycle I successfully managed to retrieve pricing information for three different shares and display these in the console. I do this by importing the necessary modules and using the functions within them to get the latest asking price for specific shares.

```python
# Import necessary modules from the Alpaca API
from alpaca.data.historical import StockHistoricalDataClient
from alpaca.data.requests import StockLatestQuoteRequest

# Set API key and secret key
API_KEY = "PKBFRFWBV2IIXYC9BPQ5"
SECRET_KEY = "9rZHrcqHyVAqh6TrljCTayCfghqTmY9HRpkBK7uE"

# Create an instance of the StockHistoricalDataClient class using the provided API key and secret key
stock_client = StockHistoricalDataClient(
    API_KEY, SECRET_KEY)

# Create a StockLatestQuoteRequest object with the desired symbols
multisymbol_request_params = StockLatestQuoteRequest(symbol_or_symbols=["SPY", "GLD", "TLT"])

# Use the get_stock_latest_quote method of the stock_client object to retrieve the latest stock quotes for the specified symbols
latest_multisymbol_qoutes = stock_client.get_stock_latest_quote(multisymbol_request_params)

# Retrieve the latest ask price for each symbol
gld_latest_ask_price = latest_multisymbol_qoutes["GLD"].ask_price
spy_latest_ask_price = latest_multisymbol_qoutes["SPY"].ask_price
tlt_latest_ask_price = latest_multisymbol_qoutes["TLT"].ask_price

# Print the current price of each symbol
print("The current price of TLT is " + str(tlt_latest_ask_price))
print("The current price of SPY is " + str(spy_latest_ask_price))
print("The current price of GLD is " + str(gld_latest_ask_price))
```

## Challenges

The main challenge I experienced was getting the API set up. I had issues downloading and updating pip and therefore was unable to install the API. This was very costly to my progress as I had to try many different solutions to fix the problem. Eventually I was able to fix this and was able to program a solution quite easily.

## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                  | What I expect                                      | What actually happens            | Pass/fail |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run index.py file in terminal | The price of different shares to be displayed      | As expected                      | Pass      |
| 2    | Open html file in browser     |  Share data should be displayed in browser console | Data is not displayed in console | Fail      |
