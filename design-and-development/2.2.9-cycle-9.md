# 2.2.9 Cycle 9

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle, I create a JavaScript function that will validate the user inputs before they are submitted and processed. This is done with a set of if statements. Every possibility is covered so no matter what the user enters, the correct data will always be entered. In addition to this I added a link to a website that gives information on the risks of trading.
