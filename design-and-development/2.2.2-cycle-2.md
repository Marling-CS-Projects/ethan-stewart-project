# 2.2.2 Cycle 2

## Design

This cycle is meant to focus on the beginnings of the algorithm I will be using to pick and trade shares. I will use an API called Alpaca API. This will give me access to a paper trading system (not using real life shares). This code needs to be able to fetch my account information from Alpaca.

## Objectives

* [x] Begin foundation of the Alpaca API
* [x] Fetch my account information from Alpaca

## Usability features

This part of the program is not seen by the user. However I have taken steps to ensure that its easier for me to follow the code whilst I'm writing it. To do this I have added ample spacing between each line and comments to remind me of what each part does.

## Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Alpaca        | Stores all the functions from the Alpaca API |
| APIkey        | Store my account API key                     |
| APISecret     | Stores my secret API key                     |

## Pseudocode

```
IMPORT '@alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api' as Alpaca

CONSTANT APIkey = <my api key>
CONSTANT APIsecret = <my secret key>
```
