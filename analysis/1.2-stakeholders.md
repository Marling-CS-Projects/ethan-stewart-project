## Who will use my product?

As I mention in 1.1, the use of algorithms for trading has taken off ever since it was made legal. It has become extremely beneficial to use due to its efficiency at buying and selling shares and its effectiveness at recognizing patterns. But who uses these algorithms? Is it individuals, or mostly big firms?. Well, according to[ Investopedia (2019)](../reference-list.md), algo-trading is mainly used by institutional investors and big brokerage firms to reduce costs associated with trading. According to research, algorithmic trading is especially beneficial for large order sizes that are made up of as much as 10% of overall trading volume.

Algo-trading has gained popularity among both retail and institutional traders in the 21st century. It is popular among investment banks, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds that need to stretch out the execution of a larger order or execute deals that are too quick for human traders to react to.

As mentioned before, institutional traders make up a large proportion of algo-traders, due to the scale of orders placed and the benefits of algo-trading for larger order sizes. Institutional investors use several algorithmic tactics daily in the volatile trading markets that power the stock market. These strategies allow investors to lower trade expenses and increase their profitability. Institutional investors are very concerned about their capital. Therefore, they require a system capable of making good decisions. Automation of processes reduces overtrading dramatically because some traders buy and sell at the first indication of a trade window opening. These techniques reduce the possibility of errors brought on by people. It responds to marketing conditions in a split second, making it a desired investment option.

North America is expected to dominate the algo-trading market in the future. North America is expected to have the most significant market share. The main drivers of market growth are the rising investments in trading technologies (such as blockchain), the growing presence of algorithmic trading suppliers, and the expanding government backing for international trading. According to Wall Street data, algo-trading accounts for around 60-73% of the overall US equity trading. According to Select USA, the US financial markets are the largest and most liquid globally. Sentient Technologies, an AI company based in the United States, operates a hedge fund that built an algorithm processing millions of data points to find trading patterns and forecast trends. Many firms are opening new branches in the US, giving them access to a wide range of new trading capabilities. ([Mordor Intelligence, 2023](../reference-list.md))
