# 2.2.4 Cycle 5

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle I implemented a basic trading strategy into my program. I simulated this strategy in the year 2000 for the whole year, monitoring the closing prices of a specific share every day. I am going to continue to use historical share data as it is easier to test the strategy. I may implement it to live data in a later cycle.

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* [ ] Buy and sell shares
* [ ] Make a profit

#### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

Similar to previous cycles, this cycle does focus on the user experience, more the functionality of the program.

#### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable            | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self.dataclose`    | A reference to the "close" line in the data\[0] dataseries. It represents the closing price of the financial instrument being analyzed.               |
| `self.order`        | A variable used to keep track of pending orders. It is set to `None` when there are no pending orders.                                                |
| `order`             | An argument in the `notify_order` method, representing an order object that contains information about the status and details of a trading order.     |
| `order.status`      | A property of the `order` object that indicates the status of the order (e.g., Submitted, Accepted, Completed, Canceled, Margin, Rejected).           |
| `order.isbuy()`     | A method of the `order` object that checks if the order is a buy order. Returns `True` if it is a buy order, otherwise `False`.                       |
| `order.issell()`    | A method of the `order` object that checks if the order is a sell order. Returns `True` if it is a sell order, otherwise `False`.                     |
| `self.bar_executed` | A variable used to keep track of the number of bars (time periods) during which an order has been executed. It is updated when an order is completed. |

#### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>



```
Create a new strategy:

    Define a function log(txt, dt=None):
        If dt is not specified, set dt to the date of the first data point
        Print the date in ISO format and the given text

    Initialize the strategy:

        Set self.dataclose to refer to the closing price of the first data series
        Set self.order to None to track pending orders

    Define a function notify_order(order):
        If the order status is Submitted or Accepted, do nothing and return
        If the order status is Completed:
            If the order is a buy order, log "BUY EXECUTED" with the executed price
            If the order is a sell order, log "SELL EXECUTED" with the executed price
            Update the bar_executed variable with the number of bars executed
        If the order status is Canceled, Margin, or Rejected, log "Order Canceled/Margin/Rejected"
        Set self.order to None

    Define a function next():
        Log the closing price of the current data point
        If there is a pending order, do nothing and return
        If not in a position:
            If the current closing price is less than the previous closing price:
                If the previous closing price is less than the one before it:
                    Log "BUY CREATE" with the current closing price
                    Execute a buy order and set self.order
        If in a position and the number of bars executed is greater than or equal to (bar_executed + 5):
            Log "SELL CREATE" with the current closing price
            Execute a sell order and set self.order

```

### Development <a href="#development" id="development"></a>

The outcome from this cycle was very positive. Everything went very smoothly and the program traded a specific share every day for a year. It even made a profit. I used the console effectively to see how the strategy was working and how it made decisions.

````python
```python
class Strategy(bt.Strategy):

    def log(self, txt, dt=None):
        dt = dt or self.datas[0].datetime.date(0)
        print('%s, %s' % (dt.isoformat(), txt))

    def __init__(self):
        self.dataclose = self.datas[0].close
        self.order = None

    def notify_order(self, order):
        if order.status in [order.Submitted, order.Accepted]:
            return

        if order.status in [order.Completed]:
            if order.isbuy():
                self.log('BUY EXECUTED, %.2f' % order.executed.price)
            elif order.issell():
                self.log('SELL EXECUTED, %.2f' % order.executed.price)
            self.bar_executed = len(self)

        elif order.status in [order.Canceled, order.Margin, order.Rejected]:
            self.log('Order Canceled/Margin/Rejected')

        self.order = None

    def next(self):
        self.log('Close, %.2f' % self.dataclose[0])

        if self.order:
            return

        if not self.position:
            if self.dataclose[0] < self.dataclose[-1]:
                if self.dataclose[-1] < self.dataclose[-2]:
                    self.log('BUY CREATE, %.2f' % self.dataclose[0])
                    self.order = self.buy()

        else:
            if len(self) >= (self.bar_executed + 5):
                self.log('SELL CREATE, %.2f' % self.dataclose[0])
                self.order = self.sell()
```

The strategy, represented by the `Strategy` class, logs trading-related messages and makes buy/sell decisions based on certain conditions. In the `notify_order` method, it tracks the status of trading orders, logs executed orders, and handles cancellations or rejections. The `next` method, called for each new data point, logs closing prices and checks if conditions are met to initiate buy orders when the current close is lower than the previous two closes or sell orders when a position is held for at least five bars. This code showcases a basic trading strategy that can be further customized for more complex trading scenarios.

#### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

The main challenge I encountered was setting up the modpath and datapath variables. This was something I was not familiar with however Backtrader had a solution on the website which I was able to use to help me access the data file.
