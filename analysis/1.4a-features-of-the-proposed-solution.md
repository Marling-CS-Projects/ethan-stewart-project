# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## User interface

### Home page

I want to set the tone for the application with this homepage. Therefore, ease of navigation is very important. Users of this application likely have very little experience with using these types algorithms so making the experience as smooth and as simple as possible is important. Different features within in the site must be clearly labelled. A small description of some sort will pop up when hovering over a button. This will inform users what that particular feature will do. The image below shows a very basic concept of what the page could look like. Another feature which I plan on adding to the site is a search bar. This will allow people to search any part of the site for a specific piece of information. This will aid those struggling to navigate the site, however I plan on designing it in such a way that this shouldn't be necessary.

### Graph display

In trading, charts are the most important thing that you use to make an informed decisions on what stocks to buy. Therefore, I plan to stick with the generic red and green which will provide plain and simple information about market activity at a glance. All colors must stand out so placing these charts on a black background will improve visibility and reduce clutter.&#x20;

In addition to this, on the charts, I will also display points at which the algorithm has bought and sold shares. This will be accompanied by a little blurb explaining the reasoning behind the purchase / sale. It is important to give the user as much information about the algorithms so the user can step in and take control of the portfolio if necessary. Whilst the system will be mostly AI controlled, some user control features will be implemented for peace of mind reasons.

### Outflow and inflow management

One of the features I will add to my site is outflow and inflow management. Basically understanding what money your portfolio is receiving or where money is being lost. This is an incredibly important feature as it will give the user an overview of the return rate of their portfolio. The center piece of this will be a red or green text plus arrow indicating the direction of returns on your portfolio, whether that be positive (green) or negative (red). It will then contain a break down of where that money is going / coming from. For example, which shares you are investing in, money lost from those investments, which investments are gaining you money, how much money remains in your portfolio wallet. Below is an example of some of the information that I could display however some of it is not necessary for this project.

### Manage portfolio

Under this tab, you will have access to your portfolio and have the option to edit which shares are in your portfolio. For simplicity sake I will limit the number of different shares you can invest in to 3. There are resources out there that give access to / simulate market conditions that I will use to update a database which you can search through to help find the right trade for you. In addition to this the there will be a feature to control how much of your wallet can be spent on a particular share. This can be filtered by either; the amount of money or number of shares if money is not a problem. This will also encourage risk management which is incredibly important when trading.&#x20;

**Note: No real money will be used in this project.**

### Information page

Trading is obviously not an easy thing to get your head around. Algo-trading as a concept as well can take some explaining to get a good level of understanding. Therefore, I will be adding an information section to my page which should aid in the understanding of any concepts the user does not understand. In this section I plan on including any YouTube resources which provide accurate information about the markets and any other informative webpages. Information about algo-trading will be equally valuable as its important for users to understand the process carried out in order to make an automated trade. Basically aiming for a high level of transparency of what my program is doing.

### Market management

The purpose of this page is to ensure the user is up to date on any significant changes in the market. The user should be able to search/filter through all the shares on the market database and see its current performance. It will display the name of the stock, the shortened version of its name and its current performance indicated by a percentage colored either green or red to help those who are visually impaired. Below is an example of how this could look. I will include, as said previously, the full name of the stock so its easier to understand. One feature that will be cool is the filter by country. This will allow people to see the best performing stocks in a specific market and make a judgement on how a market is performing.

### News page

Provide up to date news on markets around the world from trusted news sites such as CNBC or BBC news. This will add that extra level of transparency to help the user get to grips with trading and the market as a whole. I should be able to use a fixed link as the websites should update and keep the same link.

## Limitations

### Information Variety

Whilst I would like to provide as much information as possible about specific shares, this is likely not going to be possible because of a lack of time. Providing this information would mean I would have to learn about the stock market in a large amount of detail and so will the user. When considering the aim of the site which is to keep it simple to understand, this is not a feature that I deem to fall under that aim.

### Stock interactions

I initially wanted to include a separate page for each stock and add interactive charts which would allow users to see exact values from any point in the last day by hovering over the chart. However, once again, I fear time constraints may get in the way of adding these features as they can be complex. In addition to this it takes unnecessary time creating a page for each stock and then testing them to ensure they function as intended. (especially when there are about 4000 public firms in the US alone, each of which have their own share)

### Optimization

The program is not going to be optimized I will likely perform quite slow. However I will put effort into ensuring the code used to carry out an operation is as simple as possible, so I can reduce the overall stress on the CPU and maximize performance to the best of my ability.

### Speed of trading

Whilst I would love to make a high frequency trading program, I plan on keeping to a longer term plan. What this means is that the algorithm will only make trades I it thinks the share price is going to take a massive hit (similar to what Tesla Inc. is experiencing currently: see image below). The algorithm will monitor the stocks and make a decision to sell when it detects that the share will drop in price, or re-buy when it detects the share is going to recover. This will be done by detecting patterns which have been recognized from past data which are commonly followed by drops / rises in share price.
