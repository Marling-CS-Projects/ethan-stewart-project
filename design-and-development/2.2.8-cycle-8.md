# 2.2.8 Cycle 8

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle I use css to customise the html page. This is part of my aim to make the user experience as good as possible. This means making the page visually nice to look and use, including a couple of animations.

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* Style the web page to a reasonable standard
