According to analysts, 70% of US equities in 2013 were carried out by algorithm trading and the use of trading algorithms has since then been increasing. Algorithm trading first emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the creation of the internet. It wasn't until 1998 when algorithm trading really started to pick up, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission authorizing electronic exchanges. (The Robust Trader, 2022). The foundation for algorithm trading was laid on innovations in high frequency trading. The first innovation in HFT came from a man called Julius Reuter, in the 19th century. He used a combination combination of technology including telegraph cables and a fleet of carrier pigeons to run a news delivery system. (Quantinsti, 2015)
