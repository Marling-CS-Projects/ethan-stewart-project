### Implementation Shortfall

Implementation shortfall is the difference between the prevailing price or value when a buy or sell decision is made with regard to a security and the final execution price or value after taking into consideration all commissions (Investopedia, 2022). According to Excellarate, you can, "take advantage of favorable price movements by calculating the optimal time horizon to execute a trade using the stock’s historical volume profile, liquidity and volatility".

### Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP)

TWAP is the measure of an asset’s average price over a predetermined period of time. TWAP trading algorithms seek to optimize a trade’s average price while executing over a specified time period (River Financial). Using this you can "minimize market impact by breaking a large order into smaller ones using evenly divided start and end time intervals" (Excellarate).
