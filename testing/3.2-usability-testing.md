# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is it easy to understand what the program does? Is it clear what data you need to provide?            |
| 2 - Efficient      | is it clear where you need to enter user data? Is the level of user input low enough?                 |
| 3 - Engaging       | Does it give a good introduction to trading? Is there enough information for you to do more research. |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs in the program? Does the program run well without crashing.                        |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Was it difficult to get started? Was there maybe to much user input?                                  |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

In order to gather opinions on my program I used a google form to get information from my friends and family. I based the questions off my success criteria.



### Effective and Efficient

From the graph you can see that all people completely agreed that the input prompts were easy to understand. This is good as it was important that people knew what data to enter otherwise it you enter an endless cycle of error messages.

Another good result is that all people agreed that the UI was structured in a simple way. This is once again very important as the UI often dictates the speed at which someone is able to navigate a site.

From the results above, you can see that the majority of people somewhat agree that the level of user input is low. This is about what I expected. Possibly using dropdown menus for some of the data entry would be more efficient as it removes the need to type. However, the number of sections of information required are necessary for the program to run, so there is nothing I can do about those.

The results above show that every is in some sort of agreeance that the result of the trade loads in a reasonable time. Some of the slower loading times can be justified by the slower network speed at the location of testing.



### Engaging and Easy to learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The above results show that everyone is in somewhat agreeance that the UI is visually pleasing. This is a good result as it shows people are comfortable using the program and would be happy using it for longer periods of time.

Most people were overall in agreeance with the level of customisation for the order. I think most people testing were aware of the constraints in place which prevented me from doing adding certain features

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The above results shows that everyone is in agreeance that the period of time was adequate to simulate the trades. In order to get an efficient live data API, real money become involved which I was not willing to bare the cost of. So its positive that people think that the time frame was adequate.

The above results could use improve as a small proportion disagree that the number of stocks available to simulate is too small. I would agree with this person. My intention was to add more however I was once again constrained by the cost of this feature.

The above result shows clear evidence that people were satisfied with the warning I provided them. In the table below, people were especially happy with the website provided which provides information on the risks of trading.

### Error tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the above result you can see the vast majority of people had no issues with the code. The one person who did was not a problem with the code but a saving error. I didn't save a change I made so the webpage was still running an older save.



### General feedback

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The feedback provided above is mostly about what I mentioned earlier, to do with customisability. These are not new concerns as those features are not implementable with the current framework, cost, and time restraints.
