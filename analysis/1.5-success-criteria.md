### UI

| Ref. No. | Criterion                        | Justification                                                                                                                                                                  | Reference                                                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Easy to understand               | The prompts for the user to enter data must be easy to understand as it is important they enter the right information. This is so the algorithm can produce the right response | [Home Page](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#home-page)             |
| 2        | Simplicity                       | The project will be aimed at individuals which I established as key [stakeholders](1.2-stakeholders.md). Some of these users will be inexperienced so simplicity is key        | [Home Page](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#home-page)             |
| 3        | Site animations for user actions | Use simple animations to improve the user experience of the site. This could include add animations when clicking buttons.                                                     | [Site animations](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#site-animations) |
| 4        | Easy to use                      | Anyone should be able to use the program. This addresses the new users which may use the website that have little to no experience                                             |                                                                              |
| 5        | Pleasant to use                  | The user should feel comfortable using the system so it should look professional. This will encourage the user to return to using the website and keep them engaged.           |                                                                              |

### Criterion 1

One of the most important criterion was ease of understanding program.

### Functionality and features

<table><thead><tr><th>Ref. No.</th><th>Criterion</th><th width="253">Justification</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6</td><td>Order customisation</td><td>I want the user to be able to customize the size of the orders they are placing. This is important for most <a href="1.2-stakeholders.md">stakeholders</a> as order sizes are subject to opinion.</td><td><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#outflow-and-inflow-management">Outflow and Inflow management</a></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Money made</td><td>The user should be able to see how much money they are making with on the chosen stock. This is so they can track progress and ensure the algorithm is working.</td><td><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#manage-portfolio">Manage Portfolio</a></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Multiple stock</td><td>Allow the user to choose which stock they want to buy. This means users have greater flexibility so they are not limited to a stock that may not perform.</td><td><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#manage-portfolio">Manage Portfolio</a></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Market management</td><td>A more advanced searching feature which allows the user to access more information than from the portfolio manager. This expands the usefulness of the website.</td><td><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#market-management">Market management</a></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Algorithm</td><td>An algorithm that can buy and sell shares based on the users inputs. This reduces the users emotional input which could affect buying and selling. I identified this problem in <a href="1.1-problem-identification.md">1.1</a></td><td><a href="1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graph-display">Buying and selling</a></td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Simulation start date</td><td>Allows the users to choose the start date of the simulation so they can avoid financial disasters like 2007. It also means they can include them to see how a specific stock performed.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Doesn't reset</td><td>The user should be able to use the simulator as many times as they wish. This means there is no need to reload the page when you have run it once so keep the user engaged.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

| 13       | Run Smoothly | The user should be able to use the site without major lag spikes and no crashes. If you can't use the site then you can't enjoy it so this a must. |           |
