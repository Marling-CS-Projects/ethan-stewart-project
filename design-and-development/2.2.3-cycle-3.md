# 2.2.3 Cycle 3

## Design

In this second cycle I have made a start to the algorithm that will determine an average that will be used to determine whether or not a trade is recommended. This is done using a 50 minute and 20 minute average. This part of the algorithm should be able to fetch the bar data from 50 minutes ago.

### Objectives

* [x] Get bar data from 50 minutes ago
* [x] Get the time from 50 minutes ago

### Usability Features

This part of the program is not seen by the user. However I have taken steps to ensure that its easier for me to follow the code whilst I'm writing it. To do this I have added ample spacing between each line and comments to remind me of what each part does.

### Key Variables

Sure! Here is the table:

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SMA\_20                         | Initialized to 0 but not used in the code                                                                                                                                                    |
| SMA\_50                         | Initialized to 0 but not used in the code                                                                                                                                                    |
| stock\_client                   | An instance of the StockHistoricalDataClient class from the alpaca library used to get stock bars                                                                                            |
| get\_bar\_from\_50\_min(symbol) | A function that gets the stock bars for the last 50 minutes for the given symbol using the stock\_client instance. It then prints the time 50 minutes ago and the bars for that time period. |

### Pseudocode

```
FUNCTION get_bar_from_50_min(symbol):
    SET now to current datetime
    SET time_50_minutes_ago to now minus 50 minutes

    CREATE initial_data as StockBarsRequest with symbol, timeframe of minute, start time of time_50_minutes_ago, and end time of now

    SET bars to result of get_stock_bars with initial_data

    PRINT time_50_minutes_ago
    PRINT bars
END FUNCTION

```

## Development

I created a function which would retrieve the stock bar data from the past 50 minutes to be used in an average calculation. I set two constants for the current time and the time 50 minutes ago. I used these to fill in the args for the StockBarRequest function. I used a preset symbol to start with. I then printed the time 50 minutes ago, to ensure it worked, and the bars I collected.

```python
# Defining a function get_bar_from_50_min(symbol) which gets the stock bars for the last 50 minutes for the given symbol
def get_bar_from_50_min():
    now = datetime.now()
    time_50_minutes_ago = now - timedelta(minutes=50)

    request_params = StockBarsRequest(symbol_or_symbols="SPY", start=time_50_minutes_ago, end=now, timeframe=TimeFrame.Minute)

    bars = stock_client.get_stock_bars(request_params)

    # Printing the time 50 minutes ago and the bars for that time period.
    print(bars)
    print(time_50_minutes_ago)

get_bar_from_50_min()
```

### Outcome

The outcome was not great. Whilst I was able to fetch the time from 50 minutes ago, I am having problems fetching the bar data. This problem seems to be related to how my Alpaca account is set up and does not seem to be a programming error.

### Challenges

Certainly figuring out how to set the time from 50 minutes ago was a challenge. There never seemed to be a solution that matched the problem that I had. After further research into the datetime module, I found a function called timedelta. It represents the difference between two datetime objects. In using this I was able to subtract 50 minutes off the current time which worked well.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                   | What actually happens                              | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code     | The time from 50 minutes ago is printed in the console          | As expected                                        | Pass      |
| 2    | Run code     | The bar data for the specified stock is printed in the console. | I was unable to fetch the bar due to account setup | Fail      |
