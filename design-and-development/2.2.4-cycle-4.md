# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle I made a realisation that severly impacted any progress I can make with the project. The API I was using had both a free version and a payed for version. The payed for version was not something I was willing to pay for so I made a change to the API I am using. I switched to Backtrader, which is a "feature-rich Python framework for backtesting and trading" (Backtrader)

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* [ ] Set the cash limit for my account
* [ ] Link data to account

#### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

Whilst this part of the code doesn't strictly have any usability features, it will be the beginning of a smooth automated user experience which should involve very little human input. At this stage though their may be more than first anticpated.

#### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account`               | An instance of the `bt.Cerebro()` class, which is the core of backtrader and allows you to run backtesting or live data feed trading. |
| `modpath`               | The directory name of the script that is currently being run.                                                                         |
| `datapath`              | The path to the data file ‘orcl-1995-2014.txt’.                                                                                       |
| `datafeed`              | An instance of the `bt.feed.YahooFinanceCSVData()` class, which is a data feed that reads CSV data in the format of Yahoo Finance.    |
| `fromdate` and `todate` | The start and end dates for the data feed.                                                                                            |
| `reverse`               | A boolean value indicating whether to reverse the data feed.                                                                          |

#### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>



```
1. Import the necessary libraries (backtrader, datetime, os.path, sys)

2. Define a class called Strategy that inherits from bt.Strategy

3. If this script is the main program being run:

    4. Create an instance of bt.Cerebro and assign it to a variable called account

    5. Set the cash of the account's broker to 100000.0

    6. Get the directory name of the script that is currently being run and assign it to a variable called modpath

    7. Join modpath with '../../datas/orcl-1995-2014.txt' to get the path to the data file and assign it to a variable called datapath

    8. Create an instance of bt.feed.YahooFinanceCSVData with the following parameters:
        - dataname: datapath
        - fromdate: January 1, 2000
        - todate: December 1, 2000
        - reverse: False
       Assign this instance to a variable called datafeed

    9. Add datafeed to account

    10. Print the starting portfolio value of account's broker

    11. Run account

    12. Print the final portfolio value of account's broker

```

### Development <a href="#development" id="development"></a>

The outcome is about what I expected. First of all, the program actually ran which is a positive start for a new framework. The main aim of this cycle was to get an instance of a cerebro account created and set a cash value. I was able to do this and display the cash value in the console. Linking the data feed from Yahoo Finance was also a priority. Whilst there isn't a way a can 100% confirm that this has been done successfully, the program would not run and would display error messages. This was not the case so I am happy with how it turned out.

```python
# Import necessary libraries for backtrading, date and time handling, and system operations
from __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals)
import backtrader as bt
import datetime
import os.path
import sys

# Check if this script is the main program being run
if __name__ == '__main__':

    # Create an instance of bt.Cerebro and assign it to a variable called account
    account = bt.Cerebro()

    # Get the directory name of the script that is currently being run and assign it to a variable called modpath
    modpath = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(sys.argv[0]))
    
    # Join modpath with '../../datas/orcl-1995-2014.txt' to get the path to the data file and assign it to a variable called datapath
    datapath = os.path.join(modpath, '../../datas/orcl-1995-2014.txt')

    # Create an instance of bt.feeds.YahooFinanceCSVData with the following parameters:
    # dataname: datapath
    # fromdate: January 1, 2000
    # todate: December 31, 2000
    # reverse: False
    data = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceCSVData(
        dataname=datapath,
        fromdate=datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1),
        todate=datetime.datetime(2000, 12, 31),
        reverse=False)

    # Add data to account
    account.adddata(data)

    # Set the cash of the account's broker to 100000.0
    account.broker.setcash(100000.0)

    # Print the starting portfolio value of account's broker
    print('Starting Portfolio Value: %.2f' % account.broker.getvalue())

    # Run account
    account.run()

    # Print the final portfolio value of account's broker
    print('Final Portfolio Value: %.2f' % account.broker.getvalue())


```

I started by making an account which is an instance of cerebro. This then allowed me to link a data feed to it. I linked it with the Yahoo Finance service, and using the datapath variable, I can direct the program to the data file that I need to use. I was then able to link this to my account which will allow me to acccess stocks in the future.

#### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

The main challenge I encountered was setting up the modpath and datapath variables. This was something I was not familiar with however Backtrader had a solution on the website which I was able to use to help me access the data file.
