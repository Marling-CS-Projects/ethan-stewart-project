# 1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements

## Development Requirements

Development requirements relate to the software and hardware that is needed to be able to develop and run the project. In the case of my project, I will be using a web browser to run my program, so I will need to look at requirements for the most popular web browsers.&#x20;

Because this project is web based, users will need to have access to a device with a web browser (most likely a PC instead of a mobile advice).

As of February 2023, Google Chrome is the most used browser at 65.74%, following far behind in second and third is Safari and Edge respectively at 18.86% and 4.27%. (Oberlo, 2023)

## User Requirements

Describe what a user will need to run the solution

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OS1" %}
