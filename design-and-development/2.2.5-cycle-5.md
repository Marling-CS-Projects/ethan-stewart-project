# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

### Design <a href="#design" id="design"></a>

In this cycle I implemented a basic trading strategy into my program. I simulated this strategy in the year 2000 for the whole year, monitoring the closing prices of a specific share every day. I am going to continue to use historical share data as it is easier to test the strategy. I may implement it to live data in a later cycle.

#### Objectives <a href="#objectives" id="objectives"></a>

* [ ] Buy and sell shares
* [ ] Make a profit

#### Usability Features <a href="#usability-features" id="usability-features"></a>

Similar to previous cycles, this cycle does focus on the user experience, more the functionality of the program.

#### Key Variables <a href="#key-variables" id="key-variables"></a>

| Variable            | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self.dataclose`    | A reference to the "close" line in the data\[0] data series. It represents the closing price of the financial instrument being analysed.              |
| `self.order`        | A variable used to keep track of pending orders. It is set to `None` when there are no pending orders.                                                |
| `order`             | An argument in the `notify_order` method, representing an order object that contains information about the status and details of a trading order.     |
| `order.status`      | A property of the `order` object that indicates the status of the order (e.g., Submitted, Accepted, Completed, Cancelled, Margin, Rejected).          |
| `order.isbuy()`     | A method of the `order` object that checks if the order is a buy order. Returns `True` if it is a buy order, otherwise `False`.                       |
| `order.issell()`    | A method of the `order` object that checks if the order is a sell order. Returns `True` if it is a sell order, otherwise `False`.                     |
| `self.bar_executed` | A variable used to keep track of the number of bars (time periods) during which an order has been executed. It is updated when an order is completed. |

#### Pseudocode <a href="#pseudocode" id="pseudocode"></a>



```
Create a new strategy:

    Define a function log(txt, dt=None):
        If dt is not specified, set dt to the date of the first data point
        Print the date in ISO format and the given text

    Initialize the strategy:

        Set self.dataclose to refer to the closing price of the first data series
        Set self.order to None to track pending orders

    Define a function notify_order(order):
        If the order status is Submitted or Accepted, do nothing and return
        If the order status is Completed:
            If the order is a buy order, log "BUY EXECUTED" with the executed price
            If the order is a sell order, log "SELL EXECUTED" with the executed price
            Update the bar_executed variable with the number of bars executed
        If the order status is Canceled, Margin, or Rejected, log "Order Canceled/Margin/Rejected"
        Set self.order to None

    Define a function next():
        Log the closing price of the current data point
        If there is a pending order, do nothing and return
        If not in a position:
            If the current closing price is less than the previous closing price:
                If the previous closing price is less than the one before it:
                    Log "BUY CREATE" with the current closing price
                    Execute a buy order and set self.order
        If in a position and the number of bars executed is greater than or equal to (bar_executed + 5):
            Log "SELL CREATE" with the current closing price
            Execute a sell order and set self.order

```

### Development <a href="#development" id="development"></a>

The outcome from this cycle was very positive. Everything went very smoothly and the program traded a specific share every day for a year. It even made a profit. I used the console effectively to see how the strategy was working and how it made decisions.

<pre class="language-python"><code class="lang-python">```python
# Define a class named 'Strategy' which inherits from 'bt.Strategy'
class Strategy(bt.Strategy):

    # Define a method to log the details

        dt = dt or self.datas[0].datetime.date(0)
        # Print the date and the text
        print('%s, %s' % (dt.isoformat(), txt))

    # Initialize the strategy
    def __init__(self):
        # Get the close price of the data
        self.dataclose = self.datas[0].close
        # Initialize order to None
        self.order = None

    # Define a method to notify when an order is placed
    def notify_order(self, order):
        # If order is submitted or accepted, do nothing
        if order.status in [order.Submitted, order.Accepted]:
            return

        # If order is completed
        if order.status in [order.Completed]:

            if order.isbuy():

            # Record the bar when the order was executed
            self.bar_executed = len(self)

        # If order is canceled, margin called or rejected, log it
        elif order.status in [order.Canceled, order.Margin, order.Rejected]:
            self.log('Order Canceled/Margin/Rejected')

        # Reset the order to None
        self.order = None

    # Define what to do in the next step
    def next(self):
        # Log the close price of the data
        self.log('Close, %.2f' % self.dataclose[0])

        # If there's an existing order, do nothing
        if self.order:
            return
<strong>
</strong>        # If there's no position currently held
        if not self.position:
            # If the close price is lower than previous day's close price and previous day's close price is lower than the day before that,
            if self.dataclose[0] &#x3C; self.dataclose[-1]:
                if self.dataclose[-1] &#x3C; self.dataclose[-2]:
                    # Log and create a buy order at current close price
                    self.log('BUY CREATE, %.2f' % self.dataclose[0])
                    self.order = self.buy()

        else:
            # If it has been more than 5 bars since last executed bar,
            if len(self) >= (self.bar_executed + 5):
                # Log and create a sell order at current close price
                self.log('SELL CREATE, %.2f' % self.dataclose[0])
                self.order = self.sell()

```
</code></pre>

The strategy, represented by the Strategy class, logs related messages and makes buy/sell decisions based on certain conditions. In the `notify_order` method, it tracks the status of trading orders, logs executed orders, and handles cancellations or rejections. The `next` method, called for each new data point, logs closing prices and checks if conditions are met to execute buy orders when the current close is lower than the previous two closes or sell orders when a position is held for at least five bars.

#### Challenges <a href="#challenges" id="challenges"></a>

The main challenge was finding a suitable strategy to use. Creating my own strategy was off the table because I don't have the time or the mathematical skill to come up with on. I did, however, find a recommended strategy off the Backtrader website. It is simple, however it makes a profit and allows me to focus on testing instead of finding and implementing a complex strategy.&#x20;
