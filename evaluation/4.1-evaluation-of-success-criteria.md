### Criterion 1 - fully met

Criterion 1 has been met fully by my program. The main feature of this was mostly in the wording of the data entry and any additional resources that aided in understanding. This was important as the correct data must be entered in order for the program to work. However there are counter measures in place, so in case of wrong entry there are addition explanations of the correct data to be entered.

### Criterion 2 - fully met

The core features and the features the user interacts with are all as simple as they can be. The website includes the bare minimum data entries required for the program to run. This significantly reduced the effort required to use the website, making the overall experience much simpler

### Criterion 3 - partially met

I was able to implement some basic animations, specifically to the button and data entry points. However, I would have liked to implement a few more, specifically when you submit user data. The current issue is that it feels a little janky, and an animation is required to smooth it out. In future development, I would prioritise implementing some form of animation. Possibly a loading wheel, which would be very noticeable for those on slower internet connection. Customising it to make a bit fun could also be a way to draw the users attention away from the loading time.
