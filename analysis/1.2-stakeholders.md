As I mention in 1.1, the use of algorithms for trading has taken off ever since it was made legal. It has become extremely beneficial to use due to its efficiency at buying and selling shares and its effectiveness at recognizing patterns. But who uses these algorithms? Is it individuals, or mostly big firms?. Well, according to Investopedia (2019), algo-trading is mainly used by institutional investors and big brokerage houses to reduce costs associated with trading. According to research, algorithmic trading is especially beneficial for large order sizes that are made up of as much as 10% of overall trading volume.
